#-------------------Fly-------------------#
#Do you want to enable Fly check?
#This wont have any problems with falling or jumping,
#even if the player has JumpBoost 2.
#This has beem re-written in 3.1.0 and
#takes care of NoDownlGlide.

   Fly: true

#How many moves may a player be flying before detection?
#25 Should work fine. (Standard)

#----------------KillAura-----------------#
#BETA, REPORT BUGS!
#Do you want to enable KillAura check?
#This also catches AimAura and KillAuraLegit.
#This will block anything that gives the player
#a sanificant gamplay advantage, not useless bots.
#TP-Aura is handled by Speed.

   KillAura: true

#Advanced KillAura Heuristics And Detection (AKAHAD)
#This is an advanced algorithm to catch a lot more
#combat hacks. This is generally aggersive, but
#you can make it even more agersive or rather
#permissive, but i reccomand leaving it as it is.
#How strong should AKAHAD be configured?
#
# 0 = DISABLE AKAHAD
# 1 = PERMISSIVE
# 2 = NORMAL
# 3 = AGGRESIVE
#
# PREMISSIVE will cause close to zero false positives
# even on large servers, but detection is slow and
# bypasses are more likely.
#
# NORMAL will catch most KillAuras, with a very little
# chanche of both false positives and negatives.
# I would recommand this setting because it is the most
# efficent and has the most usability.
#
# AGGRESIVE will catch nearly every KillAura very fast,
# even triggerbots are detected. This configuration is
# very agressive and may cause false positives depending
# on the situation.
#
#I reccomand to use PERMISSIVE if you have a big server.
#For other servers, use NORMAL for a normal server , only
#use AGGRESIVE if you have a smaller server or massive
#problems with KillAura hackers.

   AKAHAD: 2

#How many times must a player hack before detection?
#30 Should work fine. (Standard)
